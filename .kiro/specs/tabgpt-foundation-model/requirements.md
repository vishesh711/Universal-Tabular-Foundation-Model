# Requirements Document

## Introduction

TabGPT is a general-purpose pre-trained foundation model for tabular datasets that can adapt to any downstream task including classification, regression, anomaly detection, and survival analysis. Similar to how BERT and GPT revolutionized natural language processing through self-supervised pre-training, TabGPT aims to fill the critical gap in structured data by providing a universal pre-trained model that can transfer knowledge across different tabular datasets and schemas. The model will use transformer-based architectures with novel pre-training objectives specifically designed for tabular data, including masked cell modeling and cross-table generalization capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to use a pre-trained foundation model for tabular data, so that I can achieve better performance on downstream tasks without training from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the TabGPT model THEN the system SHALL provide a pre-trained model that has learned general tabular data representations
2. WHEN the model is applied to a new tabular dataset THEN the system SHALL demonstrate improved performance compared to training from scratch
3. WHEN the model processes different table schemas THEN the system SHALL adapt to varying column types and structures
4. IF the dataset has fewer than 1000 samples THEN the model SHALL still provide meaningful predictions through transfer learning

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want the model to support multiple downstream tasks, so that I can use one foundation model for various business problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fine-tuning for classification tasks THEN the system SHALL support binary and multi-class classification
2. WHEN fine-tuning for regression tasks THEN the system SHALL predict continuous numerical values
3. WHEN fine-tuning for anomaly detection THEN the system SHALL identify outliers and anomalous patterns
4. WHEN fine-tuning for survival analysis THEN the system SHALL predict time-to-event outcomes
5. IF a user specifies a custom task type THEN the system SHALL provide extensible interfaces for new task definitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the model to use self-supervised pre-training objectives, so that it can learn meaningful representations from unlabeled tabular data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pre-training with Masked Cell Modeling THEN the system SHALL randomly mask cells and predict their values
2. WHEN pre-training with Masked Column Modeling THEN the system SHALL mask entire columns and predict from remaining features
3. WHEN using Contrastive Row Learning THEN the system SHALL create consistent embeddings for augmented versions of the same row
4. WHEN processing time-series tables THEN the system SHALL support Next Row Prediction objectives
5. IF the dataset contains mixed data types THEN the system SHALL handle categorical, numerical, and datetime features appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data scientist working with diverse datasets, I want the model to generalize across different table schemas, so that I can apply it to datasets with completely different column structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing tables with different schemas THEN the system SHALL generate column embeddings that encode feature semantics
2. WHEN encountering new column names THEN the system SHALL use NLP encoders to understand column semantics
3. WHEN analyzing column statistics THEN the system SHALL embed statistical profiles including mean, std, skew, and entropy
4. WHEN identifying column types THEN the system SHALL distinguish between categorical, numerical, and datetime columns
5. IF columns have similar semantic meaning across datasets THEN the system SHALL recognize and leverage these similarities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a HuggingFace-style API, so that I can easily integrate TabGPT into existing ML pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the model THEN the system SHALL provide `TabGPTForClassification.from_pretrained()` interface
2. WHEN fine-tuning THEN the system SHALL integrate with HuggingFace Trainer and TrainingArguments
3. WHEN saving models THEN the system SHALL support HuggingFace Hub upload and download
4. WHEN tokenizing features THEN the system SHALL provide a feature tokenizer for preprocessing
5. IF using efficient fine-tuning THEN the system SHALL support LoRA/PEFT adapters

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a practitioner, I want the model to handle real-world tabular data challenges, so that it works effectively on production datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing missing values THEN the system SHALL handle NaN values appropriately during pre-training and inference
2. WHEN encountering categorical features THEN the system SHALL support high-cardinality categorical encoding
3. WHEN processing numerical features THEN the system SHALL normalize and handle different scales appropriately
4. WHEN dealing with imbalanced datasets THEN the system SHALL maintain performance across different class distributions
5. IF the dataset has temporal dependencies THEN the system SHALL preserve temporal ordering in embeddings

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the model architecture to be based on proven transformer designs, so that it leverages state-of-the-art techniques for tabular data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the row encoder THEN the system SHALL use FT-Transformer architecture as the backbone
2. WHEN encoding columns THEN the system SHALL implement separate embedding models for column metadata
3. WHEN fusing information THEN the system SHALL use multi-head attention across rows and columns
4. WHEN handling different data types THEN the system SHALL convert features into appropriate token embeddings
5. IF the model needs interpretability THEN the system SHALL provide attention visualization capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want comprehensive evaluation capabilities, so that I can assess model performance across different domains and tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating on benchmark datasets THEN the system SHALL support OpenML, UCI, and Kaggle dataset formats
2. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics appropriate for each task type
3. WHEN comparing to baselines THEN the system SHALL benchmark against traditional ML methods and existing tabular models
4. WHEN analyzing transfer learning THEN the system SHALL measure performance improvement from pre-training
